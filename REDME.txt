Multiplication is a fundamental arithmetic operation that involves combining groups of numbers together. It is often represented by the symbol "×" or "*", and it results in finding the total number of items when groups of equal size are combined.

For example, in the expression 3 × 4:

The number 3 represents the number of groups.
The number 4 represents the size of each group.
To perform the multiplication operation, you would calculate:

3 groups × 4 items per group = 12 total items.

In this case, multiplication is essentially a shortcut for repeated addition. Instead of adding 4 three times (4 + 4 + 4), you can perform multiplication to find the same result (3 × 4 = 12).

Multiplication has several properties, including:

Commutative property: The order of the numbers being multiplied does not affect the result. For example, 3 × 4 is the same as 4 × 3, and both equal 12.
Associative property: The grouping of the numbers being multiplied does not affect the result. For example, (2 × 3) × 4 is the same as 2 × (3 × 4), and both equal 24.
Identity property: Multiplying any number by 1 results in the original number. For example, 5 × 1 = 5.
Zero property: Multiplying any number by 0 results in 0. For example, 6 × 0 = 0.
Distributive property: Multiplication distributes over addition and subtraction. For example, a × (b + c) equals (a × b) + (a × c).
Multiplication is a crucial operation used in various mathematical concepts and real-world applications, such as calculating areas and volumes, scaling measurements, solving equations, and more. It serves as a foundational concept in mathematics and is extensively used in everyday life.
